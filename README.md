This interactive figure displays results from my BrainHack School 2020 project, "Effect of preprocessing on prediction performance of machine learning model." It makes use of plotly and ipywidgets to display regression plots that illustrate the prediction performance of the SVR model on unseen (test set) data. Plots can be viewed for each atlas and confound option included in this portion of the project analysis.

## Usage
Run `data_visualization.ipynb` to generate and view the interactive figure.
